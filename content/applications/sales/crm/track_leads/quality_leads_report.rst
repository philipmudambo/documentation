Quality leads report
====================

A *quality lead* is a lead that is likely to result in a sale. It should match the criteria most
commonly believed to help salespeople close a deal, provide more precise criteria that is specific
to each organization.

.. note::
   The specific criteria that defines a *quality lead* is different for every organization. For more
   information, see :ref:`Define quality leads <track_links/define-a-lead>`.

A quality leads report compares how many quality leads each salesperson has received over a specific
amount of time, such as the past 30 days. Sales managers can use such a report to make an informed
decision when assigning new leads.

.. example::
   A sales manager pulls the quality leads report pictured below. They see that, although everyone's
   ability to close a deal has varied, the salespeople on the right of the report have received a
   good amount of quality leads, while the salespeople on the left of the report have received
   relatively few.

   Using this information, the sales manager may decide to assign more quality leads to the sales
   people currently on the lower end, to balance out the distribution of quality leads.

Define a quality lead
=====================

A *quality lead* is one that is likely to result in a sale. Although the exact criteria for a
quality lead varies from organization to organization, it is often a combination of factors
commonly believed to be the most beneficial to a salesperson, in addition to factors valued by the
specific organization.

In addition to the basic filters and grouping options outlined in the general :ref:`Quality leads
report <track_links/create-quality-leads-report>`, consider the following filters when defining a
quality lead:

- :guilabel:`Email` or :guilabel:`Phone`: the information in these fields can help determine whether
  or not a lead is a professional contact.
- :guilabel:`Source`: this field links to the marketing and lead generation efforts from other Odoo
  applications, including *Live Chat*, *Social Marketing*, and *Email Marketing*.
- :guilabel:`Stage`: this filter can be used to eliminate or target leads that have reached specific
  stages.

.. tip::
   When adding rules to a custom filter, keep the statements preceding each rule in mind. The
   statement above a rule determines whether the search results must match **all** of the rules
   below the statement, or **any** of the rules below the statement.
